# Minesweeper Game
Minesweeper Game coded in Python using Pygame

**To run this game you need to have installed Pygame.**

## The Game

The Minesweeper game is a simple single-player puzzle video game. The objective
is to clear a board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of
them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

## My Version

I'm often dissappointed by minesweeper versions I have found online. Either because
they are not graphically interesting or they don't offer great yet obvious features
such as customizable board or helper and solver functions.

I'm also very interested in the complexity of the game which is proven to be NP-Complete
to solve.

The complete game is still work in progress but I'm looking forward to getting it out
very soon and publishing a quick tutorial.
